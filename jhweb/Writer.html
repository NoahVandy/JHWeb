                                        Before I Die, follows Peter Roberts, whose world changes for the worst when he discovers his best friend Frank has terminal Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma and only has four months to live. This sends both characters into a depression, as Frank starts to die without giving to live his life or do the things he’s wanted to do and Peter struggles with losing the only family he’s ever actually cared for. In a bid to get Frank out of his stump, Peter suggests they do something with his final days instead of just lying around in sorrow. That something ends up being a four month long road trip where both of them learn what family truly is and how even as life ends, it can be truly beautiful.

                                        Before I Die is a feature film that Jacob has been developing for years, and is one that he hopes to get off the ground soon. As it covers something that we can all relate to: untimely death. Jacob hopes that whenever this film gets made that everyone can find something to not only relate too, but something that helps people realize that even though people may leave us, they’re never truly gone. The scene in question takes place at the midpoint of the film, where Peter and Frank finally reveal their thoughts on the situation.

                                        Meet The McCrory’s is based of a short film Jacob had the pleasure of writing and directing, and after seeing its reception and falling in love with the characters he couldn’t help but think of more trouble they could land themselves in. The pages here are the beginnings on the pilot episodes, introducing the family and their individuals lives.

                                        After suffering a near fatal overdose, Kyle Richardson’s secret is reveled to those closet to him: he’s a drug addict. With this secret now reveled, Kyle decides it’s time to quit and must find a way to overcome his addiction before it takes him over.

                                        Withdrawal is a recent endeavor of Jacob’s that not only did he write, but direct and produce also. The film is currently making its festival run, but in the meantime, you can get a glance of the drama that unfold in the story. These scenes take place immediately after Kyle’s overdose and we get a first hand look at how it affects those closet to him.
