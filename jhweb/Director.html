                                    <p class="text-muted">After suffering a near fatal overdose, Kyle Richardson’s secret is reveled to those closet to him: he’s a drug addict. With this secret now reveled, Kyle decides it’s time to quit and must find a way to overcome his addiction before it takes him over.

                                        Withdrawal is one of Jacob’s latest films and is by the one he is most proud of. Not only does it look of a higher quality than most of his films, its also has the best dialogue and performances he’s been able to get out of his talent. As his Senior Thesis film at Liberty University, Jacob was able to use state of the art equipment to capture this story of addiction and overcoming yourself. Jacob is most proud of this film because its one of the few projects where he was “100% in director mode”, allowing him to get extactly what he wanted from his cast and crew. “Withdrawal is a film I never thought I’d make, but I’m so happy I did. Not only is it raw and emotional, its compelling and though provoking. It’s a story that anyone can relate to, whether they’ve struggled with addiction or not, and I’m so excited too see people figure that out” -Jacob Harding. Withdrawal is currently making its festival run, and will be available to the public afterwards.

                                        XYZ is a special project to Jacob, while it might not be his best, it’s currently the only feature film under his belt, and he made it right after graduating highschool. All of highschool Jacob worked with the same crew on all his short films, all of which were close friends of his. During their senior year they decided they wanted to do one last huge project together so represent all their work together, and that ended up being XYZ. While things didn’t go as planned, as their 15-days of principle photography only captured 60-70% of the film, leaving the film to be completed when Jacob was home from college on breaks, it was a great accomplish all were proud of. Jacob personally knew all of the 50+ people who put work into this film and called on many favors from everyone for locations or to be talent in the film, which Jacob thinks is one of the coolest aspects of the film, as every single person in the film he has a personal relationship with and a story of how he got them to be in the film. “XYZ will always have a special place in my heart, because it was the first time I truly had to direct and produce something on this scale, and it taught me so much and greatly prepared me to go into college and learn even more. Plus, it’s a great bragging point when you’re in a room of film students” – Jacob Harding. XYZ was released to the public a year after its world premiere, and you can now watch it on YouTube!

                                    <p class="text-muted">The McCrorys are a perfectly "normal" family, but when a masker murderer turns up at their home they are forced to work together to defeat him. Come meet the McCrory's and see how they solve their newest family dilemma. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        Meet The McCrory’s was a surprise favorite for Jacob. Being his second film in the “Kansas City 48 Hour Film Project”, he didn’t expect much out of the film, but after drawing the genres “Horror” and “Family”, and thinking that those ideas could be great combined he came up with an idea that he still loves to this day. Meet The McCrory’s was a hit at the festival, with everyone loving its twister humor and concept. It earned an award for “Best Makeup” and “Audience Choice Best Director”, along with being in the top 10 of that years short films. “I love the McCrorys, I think that was just such a fun film to make and I want to do so much more with them. I’m currently working on turning that idea into an actual series, a Good Luck Charlie meets Dexter kind of thing. I think people would love to watch the McCrorys every week and see what kind of problem they’ve gotten themselves into and how they might use murder to get out of it, but always as a family” – Jacob Harding. Meet The McCrory’s original short film can be watched on YouTube, and the sample of the pilot script can be read in Jacob’s writer portfolio.
